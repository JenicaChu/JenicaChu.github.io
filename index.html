<p>A hobby I am interested in is baking. Baking can be a difficult hobby at time because of how complicated some recipes can be. In order to make a dessert turn out decent you need a lot of <strong>patience</strong> and make sure to measure everything <strong>accurately</strong>. Another 
tip to make sure your baked goods always come out consistant is by measuring everything using metric units instead of measuring cups. There are many good tips for baking, especially <a href=https://www.onceuponachef.com/how-to/baking-tips-how-to-get-good-results-every-time.html/> this link</a>
